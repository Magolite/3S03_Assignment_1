1.a) The for loop goes from length-1 to 1, instead of length-1 to 0, 
as the loop executes so long as the variable i, which decrements by 1 each loop, is > 0, instead of >= 0. 
This causes it to skip over the 0 index, leading it to miss the last index of the target value in the provided case

To fix it, edit this line

for (int i=x.length-1; i > 0; i--)

to this

for (int i=x.length-1; i >= 0; i--)

b) test x=null; y=3, Expected = -1
This test case does not execute the fault, as it immediately causes 
a NullPointerException to be thrown before the faulty for loop condition can be reached

c) test: x=[1,4,6,8]; y=6; Expected = 2
This test case executes the fault but does not result in an error state, as the expected returned index is not zero, 
and so the program returns the correct value before the zero index can be skipped

d) test: x=[1,4,6,8]; y=5; Expected = -1
This test case executes the fault, resulting in an error state, as the for loop executes to completion without returning early, 
reaching and skipping the zero index. However, since the target value is not in the list to begin with, and the expected result is -1, it does not fail.

e) the first error state is reached, when i is decremented to zero, 
and instead of continuing the for loop to check the zero index, 
the for loop condition is no longer met and it ends before all indices of the array can be checked


2.a) The for loop increments from 0 to length-1, instead of decrementing.
This would lead it to returning the first index of 0, instead of the last, in the provided case

To fix it, edit this line

for (int i = 0; i < x.length; i++)

To this

for (int i=x.length-1; i >= 0; i--)

b) test x=null; Expected = -1
This test case does not execute the fault, as it immediately causes 
a NullPointerException to be thrown before the faulty for loop condition can be reached

c) test: x=[0]; Expected = 0
This test case executes the fault but does not return an error state,
as there is no other index to mistakenly iterate up to, so the program behaves identically 
to the case without the fault

d) test: x=[9,4,0,2]; Expected = 2
This test case results in an error state, as the loop increments up (the wrong direction)
however, since there is only one 0 in the array, the first occurence is also the last, so it does not result in a faliure

e) the first error state is reached when we have an array of length more than one, so on the second loop, i gets incremented up
and the loop is iterated through in the wrong direction

3.a) The conditional which increments the counter accepts values that are greater than or equal
to zero, instead of just greater than them. This leads to zeros being mistakenly counted as positive when they shouldn't be

To fix it, edit this line

if (x[i] >= 0)
{
  count++;
}  

To this

if (x[i] > 0)
{
  count++;
}  

b) test x=[]; Expected = 0
This test case does not execute the fault, as the loop condition does not iterate over arrays
of length zero, so the code inside the for loop is never executed

c) test: x=[2,7,-1]; Expected = 2
This test case executes the fault but does not return an error state,
This is because there are no zeros in the array to mistakenly count as positive

d) It isn't possible to have a test here that results in an error state but not a failiure,
as if there is a zero to be mistakenly counted as positive, it will result in count being incremented
and therefore the wrong value of count will be returned

e) The first error state is reached when x[i] = 0, and the conditional mistakenly counts it as positive,
allowing count to be incremented

4.a) The conditional which increments the counter accepts values that are greater than or equal
to zero, instead of just greater than them. This leads to zeros being mistakenly counted as positive when they shouldn't be

To fix it, edit this line

if (x[i] >= 0)
{
  count++;
}  

To this

if (x[i] > 0)
{
  count++;
}
