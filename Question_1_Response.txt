Question 1 responses: 

b) [2 marks] State two things that you think are poor, incorrect, or unclear about the answers given by the generative AI technology in (a). For each, state why you think it’s unhelpful.  

- The first item that is incorrect or unclear about the given responses is that the response for system testing groups all of the platforms (Xbox Series X, PS5, Nintendo Switch, and Sega Genesis) doesn’t distinguish between what is possible on some or all of the platforms. All of these devices are grouped together, which does not account for the fact that the Sega Genesis is fundamentally different from the other consoles. Each of the newer devices has modern operating systems that can support online infrastructure, while the Genesis is cartidge-based and has no online infrastructure without the use of obscure peripherals. By treating all of these platforms as equivalent, the response ignores any potential issues caused by running the same tests across all platforms and expecting the same response. 

- The second item that is unclear or incorrect is the functionality of multiplayer cooperative gameplay. As mentioned previously, the Sega Genesis does not natively support the same online infrastructure as the other devices. The AI-provided response does not account for this, and instead generalizes the system to a series of tests that it expects to cover all devices. This is unclear as it doesn’t make a distinction of whether the functionality of this gameplay mode will be handled differently for the Genesis. The response also does not deal with the intricacies of multi-player gameplay, which may include resource sharing, player interaction logic, win conditions, and gameplay states. Logic for switching modes like this tends to be error-prone, and the lack of detail in this response does not properly address these issues.  

c) [2 marks] State two things that you think are good, valid, or helpful about the answers given by the generative AI technology in (a). For each, state why you think it’s helpful.  

- One particularly useful aspect of the generates response is the mention of system and platform compatability testing using up to 8 players for stress testing. Given the program’s clearly stated requirement of supporting gameplay for up to 8 players, running stress tests at maximum capacity is important. For a system to simultaneously support 8 players at once, computing may be more resource-heavy in order to manage networking, in-game physics, and rendering. By considering this in its’ response, the generative AI has pointed out an important component of testing along with a specific maximum-load condition in order to successfully and thoroughly test the system. 

- Another valid point that was brough up by the AI is the integration testing description. The description accurately describes a number of important considerations to keep in mind when testing the full game across multiple platforms. It gives a useful step-by-step breakdown of a sample scenario which involves the player defeating an enemy, XP increases, loot drops, multiplayer state updates, and the animation and sound trigger. It shows the concept that each of these elements may work in isolation, but are also required to function when combined together to create the full game. This raises a strong point to emphasize the importance of integration testing and why we test some combinatorial set of states and subsystems to ensure that they function as intended, both individually and within the system as a whole. 

d) [3 marks] Based on what you have learned from this, without using generative AI, state three tests for the game briefly outlined above. In at most two sentences, explain why you prefer these tests to the ones presented in (a). 

- Test 1: Mode transition testing (cooperative to competitive modes): This test will involve testing transitions between cooperative and competitive modes, to ensure that these modes function properly and update all states relating to win/loss conditions, rules such as friendly-fire, or shared resources. This is likely the most architecturally complex and risky feature of the program, and testing edge cases and specific functionalities under realistic game conditions is preferable over a genetic testing method.  

- Test 2: Memory constraint test for Sega Genesis: The Sega Genesis has 64KB of ram, which is minimal in comparison to the other modern gaming consoles, so it is necessary to test that the memory can hold up to all 8 potentially active players and all gameplay activities to ensure that the game functions as intended and if the game does fail, it does so gracefully. This is preferable over the AI-generated tests, as it tests the specific program functionality of the program with an outlier in its target hardware, and ensures that it is done in a way that is concrete, specific, and easily recreated with clear pass and fail criteria.  

- Test 3: Multiplayer state synchronization test: This test will ensure that any shared game states that are shared between players in the cooperative mode update quickly and remain consistent across players, even when run with simulated network traffic and latency. This will ensure that the game remains fair and playable for all members, and the test is preferable over the generic integration test example as it ties the core elements of cooperative gameplay with the specifics of synchronization and correctness across user games.
