Prompt:
Suppose you are developing a game. This action-adventure game involves exploration in a post-apocalyptic version of a university,
where up to eight players may be accosted by zombies, mutated professors, angry Deans, killer squirrels, and more. 
Gameplay can be both competitive and cooperative. The game is to be released on the PS5, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch and, 
for some reason known only to your designers, the Sega Genesis, which is 16-bit only and hasn’t been manufactured since 1997. 
Specify three types of tests for such a game.

Chatgpt answer:

1. Functional Testing (Gameplay & Systems Testing)

Purpose: Ensure all game mechanics and systems work as designed.

What it covers:

Player movement, combat, exploration mechanics

AI behavior (zombies, mutated professors, angry Deans, killer squirrels)

Cooperative and competitive multiplayer logic (up to 8 players)

Inventory, health, scoring, and progression systems

Save/load functionality

UI/menus working correctly

Examples:

Do zombies properly detect and chase players?

Does co-op revive logic work under all conditions?

Are competitive score calculations accurate?

Does the game crash when 8 players trigger combat simultaneously?

This ensures the game actually works as intended.

2. Compatibility & Platform Testing (Cross-Platform / Hardware Testing)

Purpose: Ensure the game runs correctly across all target platforms:

PS5

Xbox Series X

Nintendo Switch

Sega Genesis (16-bit legacy hardware)

What it covers:

Performance differences (high-end consoles vs. Switch vs. 16-bit Genesis)

Frame rate stability

Graphics scaling and memory constraints

Controller input handling across systems

Platform-specific compliance requirements (certification rules)

Special Consideration:
The Sega Genesis version will require:

Memory limitation testing

Graphics downscaling validation

Audio format compatibility checks

Cartridge constraints testing

This type of testing ensures the game works reliably across radically different hardware capabilities.

3. Multiplayer & Network Testing

Purpose: Ensure stable and fair multiplayer experiences.

What it covers:

Online matchmaking

Peer-to-peer or server-based connectivity

Latency handling

Packet loss and disconnect recovery

Synchronization between players

Cross-platform interaction (if supported)

Stress Testing Examples:

8 players fighting multiple enemies simultaneously

High-latency simulations

Mid-game player disconnect and reconnection

Competitive mode edge cases (ties, rage quits)

This ensures smooth cooperative and competitive gameplay without desynchronization or unfair advantages.

Summary

The three major test categories are:

Functional Testing – Does the game work correctly?

Compatibility/Platform Testing – Does it run properly on all systems?

Multiplayer & Network Testing – Does online play remain stable and fair?

Together, these address correctness, performance, and player experience across both modern consoles and legacy hardware.
